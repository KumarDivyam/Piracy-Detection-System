# Minor_2:Piracy-Detection-System
-	Developing a piracy detection system that can identify whether a given video is pirated or not accurately and efficiently. It system uses a Isolation Forest Model to detect anomalies in a video and display an anomaly graph with an average anomaly score. This score is later used to predict whether the video is pirated or not.
-	Implemented using Python and various libraries : scikit learn, OpenCV, Matplotlib to detect anomalies in a video by creating color histograms, edge histograms and calculation blurriness of the video by using Laplacians function
